to do:
check Google Doc 
AND

DONE (a) The main title reads "Calendar." Can we keep the title as I had written on the write-ups document?
DONE (b) The title on the cards (the month names) - can we remove the 1, 2... and keep them centre-aligned so they don't break into/appear in the next line?
DONE (c) I think that keeping the title + graphic image + text on the card is looking off/messy. The month name and graphic image on one card will be better, I guess.
DONE (d) Right now, three cards are appearing in one row, can we set it to four? Will that affect the desktop view and mobile view somehow? 
DONE (e) I don't know if this is feasible but can graphics appear moving on the cards as well? Just wanted to see how that would look :) 
DONE (f) Also, to set cards apart from the background, can we add shadows (lift/pop) to them?
(e) Can we play with a font type as well? Something that is vintage/old-school. Overall, I mean. 
DONE (f) The arrows work just fine! They don't mess with the main content and make navigation quite easy! But when one moves from one month to another, the month's name appears quickly and goes away. Can we keep month names changing on a corner and as the main content appears, it stays there? 
(g) In Muharram one, the timing and the word change is perfect! Just one thing, the text appears on the graphics, can we avoid that? We can use the space on the side as well if the text needs that (like in the list ones).
